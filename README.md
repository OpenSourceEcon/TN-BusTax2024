# Data and code for "What Business Tax Reforms would be Best for Tennessee?"
This repository contains the data and code for the analyses by [Richard W. Evans](https://sites.google.com/site/rickecon) (@rickecon) in the September 2024 article on Tennessee business tax reform as part of the article "[Tennessee Trends: The State of Tennesseeâ€™s Economy](https://www.beacontn.org/tennessee-trends-the-state-of-tennessees-economy/)," by Ron Shultis, Jason Edmonds, and [Richard W. Evans](https://sites.google.com/site/rickecon), Beacon Center of Tennessee (Sep. 12, 2024).

## How to run the code from these analyses in the cloud in your browser
We have created a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dDKVTEAm4drvNXgHpm617j-82X4xzxKh?usp=sharing) with code almost exactly the same as th code in the Jupyter Notebook [`TN_BusTax2024.ipynb`](TN_BusTax2024.ipynb) decribed in the next section. The [Google Colab notebook](hhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dDKVTEAm4drvNXgHpm617j-82X4xzxKh?usp=sharing) has the advantage of using a distribution of Python and corresponding packages that run in the cloud on remote servers instead of on your local machine. This allows you to use the notebook from any kind of device with a browser. You can execute th code, see the results, and save output to a temporary cloud folder from which you can download anything you want to keep.

## How to run the Jupyter Notebook on your machine
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook [`TN_BusTax2024.ipynb`](TN_BusTax2024.ipynb) that can be run locally on your own machine to replicate the analyses in the paper. You can also modify this notebook to use for other analyses you might want to experiment with. To run this notebook locally on your machine, do the following steps:
* Fork and clone (or download) the https://github.com/OpenSourceEcon/TN-BusTax2024 repository
* In your computer's terminal, navigate to the directory of the `TN-BusTax2024` repository on your local machine.
* Create the conda environment `tn-bustax2024-dev` by typing the following command: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
* Activate the `tn-bustax2024-dev` conda environment by typing the following command: `conda activate tn-bustax2024-dev`
* This should allow your notebook to run while this conda environment is activated.
